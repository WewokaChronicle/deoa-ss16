	<h3 class="mg-md">Biography</h3>
				
				<p>
	Robert John Braidwood was born in Detroit, Michigan, on July 29, 1907 to Scottish immigrants.  In his early years, he assisted in his father’s pharmacy after school and occasionally held part time jobs. Robert held an apprenticeship in a carpentry union during the summer prior to starting college, and the carpentry skills he acquired proved to be extremely useful years later in archaeological field camps.  In 1926, Robert attended the University of Michigan as an undergraduate, and in 1929, he graduated with a degree in architecture. </p>
	 <p>
For several months, Robert worked in an architectural office in Detroit, but because of the Great Depression, he quickly realized that a successful future in architecture would be highly unlikely.  Braidwood returned to the University of Michigan for further studies in ancient history and anthropology, successfully completing a bachelor’s degree in 1932 and a master’s in 1933.  During his studies, Braidwood was invited by his ancient history professor, Leroy Waterman, to serve as an architectural surveyor for the University of Michigan’s archaeological expedition in Seleucia for a nine-month field season.  This experience drove Robert to become and archaeologist, and he was immediately hired by the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago, to be a field assistant for their Syrian Expedition to the Amuq, a position he held for five years (Lavietes 2003).
</p>  
On his return trip home from Syria in 1963, Robert ran into a young woman on the steamboat, Linda Schreiber, who he had known in his undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan; she was currently working as a buyer for a large Chicago department store.  The two were married in January of the following year, afterwards having two children, a son and a daughter (Lesko 2003). Both Braidwoods enrolled at the University of Chicago for graduate coursework.  Robert was in pursuit of a doctoral degree in the Department of Oriental Languages and Literatures at the Oriental Institute while also completing coursework in the Department of Anthropology.  While working towards his doctoral degree, Robert also headed a meteorological mapping program for the Army Air Corps during World War II (Mortenson 2003).  In 1942, Braidwood earned his Ph.D., and in 1945 he acquired a full-time position from the University of Chicago as a prehistorian with dual appointment in the Department of Anthropology where he taught classes (Mortenson 2003).  His job was arranged so that every third year he worked in the field, excavating prehistoric sites in western Asia.
</p>
<p>  
Robert and Linda went on to work together in the United States and abroad for the next 66 years, leading archaeological expeditions with field work in Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Turkey, as well as coauthor numerous publications based on their work that greatly impacted the direction of archaeology as a discipline.  After Robert officially retired from the University of Chicago, the Braidwoods held residence in LaPorte, Indiana(Lavietes 2003).  Both developed pneumonia in 2003, and on January 15, Robert died at age 95.  Linda died the same day, only hours after, at age 93.  Robert and his wife devoted their lives to archaeological inquiry, and their contributions to the field continue to live on.
