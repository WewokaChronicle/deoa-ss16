	<h3 class="mg-md">Biography</h3>
				
				<p>
	Robert John Braidwood was born in Detroit, Michigan, on July 29, 1907 to Scottish immigrants.  In his early years, he assisted in his father’s pharmacy after school and occasionally held part time jobs. Robert held an apprenticeship in a carpentry union during the summer prior to starting college, and the carpentry skills he acquired proved to be extremely useful years later in archaeological field camps.  In 1926, Robert attended the University of Michigan as an undergraduate, and in 1929, he graduated with a degree in architecture. </p>
	 <p>
For several months, Robert worked in an architectural office in Detroit, but because of the Great Depression, he quickly realized that a successful future in architecture would be highly unlikely.  Braidwood returned to the University of Michigan for further studies in ancient history and anthropology, successfully completing a bachelor’s degree in 1932 and a master’s in 1933.  During his studies, Braidwood was invited by his ancient history professor, Leroy Waterman, to serve as an architectural surveyor for the University of Michigan’s archaeological expedition in Seleucia for a nine-month field season.  This experience drove Robert to become and archaeologist, and he was immediately hired by the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago, to be a field assistant for their Syrian Expedition to the Amuq, a position he held for five years (Lavietes 2003).
</p>  
On his return trip home from Syria in 1963, Robert ran into a young woman on the steamboat, Linda Schreiber, who he had known in his undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan; she was currently working as a buyer for a large Chicago department store.  The two were married in January of the following year, afterwards having two children, a son and a daughter (Lesko 2003). Both Braidwoods enrolled at the University of Chicago for graduate coursework.  Robert was in pursuit of a doctoral degree in the Department of Oriental Languages and Literatures at the Oriental Institute while also completing coursework in the Department of Anthropology.  While working towards his doctoral degree, Robert also headed a meteorological mapping program for the Army Air Corps during World War II (Mortenson 2003).  In 1942, Braidwood earned his Ph.D., and in 1945 he acquired a full-time position from the University of Chicago as a prehistorian with dual appointment in the Department of Anthropology where he taught classes (Mortenson 2003).  His job was arranged so that every third year he worked in the field, excavating prehistoric sites in western Asia.
</p>
<p>  
Robert and Linda went on to work together in the United States and abroad for the next 66 years, leading archaeological expeditions with field work in Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Turkey, as well as coauthor numerous publications based on their work that greatly impacted the direction of archaeology as a discipline.  After Robert officially retired from the University of Chicago, the Braidwoods held residence in LaPorte, Indiana(Lavietes 2003).  Both developed pneumonia in 2003, and on January 15, Robert died at age 95.  Linda died the same day, only hours after, at age 93.  Robert and his wife devoted their lives to archaeological inquiry, and their contributions to the field continue to live on.

<h3 class="mg-md">Archaeological Career</h3>
				
			<p>
			Robert’s first hands-on experience as a surveyor with the University of Michigan’s Selucia-on-the-Tigris expedition in 1930 instigated his passion to pursue a career in the field of archaeology.  Robert served a summer on a Native American site in Illinois and operated as a field superintendent for an early village site excavation in highland New Mexico.  Although he found the assignments enjoyable, he quickly realized that his true passion and interests lied with the prehistoric Near East (Braidwood).  Braidwood’s experience in Selucia as well as his five-year association with the Oriental Institute’s Syrian expedition in Amuq, projects that focused on mounds involving prehistoric, protohistoric, and historic communities, were critical in the development of his interests.  During his time at Amuq, Robert performed a stratigraphic test of a mound, dividing the changing pottery phases into a long series of phases.  He related his findings to other artifacts of the Near Eastern area and presented the results in his doctoral dissertation (Watson).  
</p><p>
Robert and his wife participated in a seminar headed by Robert’s dissertation professor that focused on the beginning of the archaeological record of the Near East and proceed all the way to 2000 B.C.  This seminar, combined with his research from Amuq, inspired Robert to produce what would become known as “the gap chart,” in 1945.  This tool chronologically illustrated a major gap spanning thousands of years between evidence of the last known mobile Paleolithic hunter-gatherers, and the earliest discovered agricultural settlements such as those found in the Amuq site.  Robert became infatuated with “the gap chart” and his proposition that the very first sedentary, food-producing villages must have originated at some point in this period of time.  
</p><p>
This gap in time became the subject of the Braidwoods’ first Oriental Institute expedition post-World War II, and it set the course for field work throughout their entire careers.  They hoped to return to Syria for their first expedition, but because of political tension, they were urged to begin their 1948 field work in northern Iraq.  The Braidwoods acquired excavation permits for two sites, Matarrah and Jarmo.  Jarmo, a site covering four acres atop a bluff, lying in the hills east of Kirkuk, Iraq, proved to be a sedentary community of greater interest upon excavation for many reasons, including the fact that ceramics did not appear until the uppermost third of the deposit despite it being a sedentary community throughout its entire existence (Braidwood 129).  After a successful season, the Braidwoods crafted the Iraq-Jarmo Project, and complete nine months of field work at several units of Jarmo in 1950-1951, accompanied by their children Gretel and Douglas, as well as geologist Herbert Wright (Watson 2007).  
</p><p>
Braidwood sought more expertise in identifying the faunal and botanical remains of Jarmo, as well as analysis of the prehistoric environment and climate, so he devised a plan to enlist a range of experts in the natural sciences to join his team for the subsequent season in Jarmo.  Funded by the National Science Foundation, Robert enlisted geologist Herbert Wright, paleoethnobotanist Has Helbaek, zoologist Charles Reed, radiocarbon expert Fred Matson to assist his team of archaeologists, field assistants, and camp managers in the 1954-1955 season (Watson 2007).  Braidwood’s team would help him better understand and properly identify the remains of the wild and domestic plant remains such as wheat and barley, as well as animal remains including sheep, pigs, dogs, and goats.  
</p><p>
Braidwoods particular interest in the site of Jarmo stemmed from its geological attributes, being a well hydrated highland area where plants and animals could thrive.  Robert postulated that the land could have been ideal location to find the remains of the first farmers and pastoralists (Watson 2007).  Since Jarmo was closely located to the area dubbed the “Fertile Crescent,” Braidwood eventually referred to the location as “the Hilly Flanks of Breasted’s Fertile Crescent.’”  The “Fertile Crescent” was a well-watered, hilly area of rich civilizations that developed long ago in the Near East, named by James Henry Breasted, founder of the Oriental Institute (Harms 2003).  
</p><p>
A plan was made for a fourth season of the Iraq-Jarmo Project, however, the nationalist revolution in Iraq in the summer of 1958 created and unstable political environment in the Kurdish area where Jarmo is located, so the expedition relocated in 1959-1960 under the new name of the Iranian Prehistoric Project (Watson 2007).  The season began with survey of the Kermanshah valley, and excavations followed at multiple sites including a rockshelter nearby.  Most of the excavation that occurred in Iran prior to World War II voided any botanical or faunal remains, which was of high importance to Braidwood’s crew, so a great deal of attention was paid to these particular details (Braidwood 138). 
</p><p>
After a single season in Iran, the group once again relocated after being sought out by Braidwood’s colleague, Professor Halet Çambel of Istanbul University.  The Joint Prehistoric Project, Istanbul-Chicago, was established in 1963 under the direction of Braidwood and Çambel, with the first season of field work in southeastern Turkey.  The field identified as main focus of the project was the site of Çayönü, a village hundreds of years older than Jarmo possessing more intricate architecture and artifacts.  The field work at Çayönü was identified for its great attention to detail, leaving no stone unturned.  Analysis was carried out on buildings, plant remains, animal bones, obsidian rock, as well as microfauna from lakes and ponds.  The Braidwoods, along with Çambel continued fieldwork at Çayönü until 1989 when Çambel retired.
