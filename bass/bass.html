				<h3 class="mg-md">Early Life</h3>
				<p>
					George Bass grew up in Annapolis, Maryland where his father taught English at Naval Academy. He was born in Columbus, South Carolina in December of 1932. When Bass was in high school, his passion was astronomy and attended Johns Hopkins University studying English. His sophomore year he transferred to the University of Exeter in England. The jokester experienced quite a hiccup when he was rusticated (suspended) for pulling a prank. Since he wasn’t allowed to attend the school, he went on vacation to Sicily where he began to fall in love with archaeology by looking at a Roman theater with Mouth Etna in the background. Because Johns Hopkins didn’t offer an archaeology degree, Bass decided to study Archaeology at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. In 1957, he took a break from school to serve in the army and was deployed to Korea. Here, he had his first leadership position where he was in charge of generators, trucks, the food, and operation. When he returned to the States, an archaeologist at the University of Pennsylvania named Rodney Young invited Bass to excavate a shipwreck off the coast of Cape Gelidonya in Turkey, which opened several other doors for him.

				<p>
					At this point in his life, Dr. Bass had only had one diving lesson under his belt and he still decided to take on an excavation in the Mediterranean with the heaviest current. At first, the archaeologists believed the wreck to be Mycenaean (Late Bronze Age), as indicated by the English, German and French sources.  However, after finding repeating Egyptian qedet patterns among most weighted objects as well as a lamp that had appeared to be Canaanite, Bass concluded that this ship was not Mycenaean at all, but a Near Eastern ship. Later, it was confirmed the ship was from Cyprus, which at the time, was a part of the Near Eastern world, so his initial hypothesis was correct. This excavation was the biggest, most important excavation still in the history of Nautical Archaeology, and it was Bass’s first ever diving experience, as a PhD student. In 1960 when the excavation took place, Cape Gelidonya was the oldest shipwreck known to man dating back to 1200 B.C. during the Bronze Age. This shipwreck was a breakthrough for all archaeologists because prior to this excavation, archaeologists would wait for artifacts to be brought to the surface by divers who said archaeologists could never dive. Bass proved them wrong and in 1973 founded the Institute of Nautical Archaeology (INA) where he was the President and former Archaeological Director.

					After Cape Gelidonya, Bass’s opportunities in the diving world really picked up the pace. He began excavating shipwrecks from the Bronze Age, Classical Age and a 7th century Byzantine wreck at Yassi Ada. An important site he assisted Cemal Pulak in excavating was a wreck at Uluburun, Turkey in 1984. The findings here contributed to the study of weapons, glass, metal, ship reconstruction and more, which gave archaeologists and other professionals a great look into the economy during the Bronze Age. Additionally, Bass directed and assisted in prehistoric terrestrial excavations in Greece, Turkey (site: Gordion, the capital of King Midas’s empire in the eighth century BC.), and Italy. In 1977 he directed an excavation f the 11th century “Glass Wreck” at Serçe Limanı, Turkey. The most impressive feat about Dr. Bass is that he not only began the most historic shipwreck excavation of all time after a single diving lesson, but also that he was young, still in school, was the first person to ever excavate an ancient shipwreck entirely, and was/is the first and most experienced and successful diver in the entire field of nautical archaeology.

			<h3 class="mg-md">Underwater Archaeology</h3>
				<p>
					Although archaeological divers were not well respected amongst other archaeological fields, it is more than likely the most convenient grounds for excavation. Water acts as a preservative, protecting wood and other perishable artifacts from sunken ships and boats allowing more accurate dating and analyzing than dirt and ground above the surface does. This allows for nautical archaeologists to easily have more accurate data on top of an excavating experience like no other. Unfortunately, George Bass ended his underwater archaeological career in 1969 due to a fatal experience of a co-diver. Shortly after he founded the INA.

			<h3 class="mg-md">George Bass: Present Day</h3>
				<p>
					After diving for over 40 years, Dr. George Bass retired at 68 in December of 2000. In 1976 when the INA moved it’s headquarters to Texas A&M University, as President, Bass spent most of his time here and began teaching. He wrote and published many informational books detailing his career and special excavations. In 1982, Yassi Ada I: A Seventh Century Byzantine Shipwreck was published as well as Ships and Shipwrecks of the Americas in 1988, Cape Gelidonya: a Bronze Age Shipwreck in 1967, Serce Limani: an Eleventh-Century Shipwreck in 2004, as well as the collection of books, “Beneath the Seven Seas”. In 2002, Bass was awarded the National Medal of Science presented by President George W. Bush – among his many awards including the Archaeological Institute of America’s Gold Medal in 1986 and Lucy Wharton Drexel Medal for Achievement in Archaeology in 2010.
